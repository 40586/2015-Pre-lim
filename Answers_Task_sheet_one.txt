Task 2:
q1. you get an index error
q2. you receive the message ' This is not a legal move' and are asked to re enter a move.
q3. The piece is moved off the board
q4. Index out of range error
q5. moving the piece off of the bottom or right of the board both produced index errors,
	,moving it off the top made the piece disappear. Interestingly moving it off the left
	generates a pre-set message, telling the user that it isn't a valid move, which would 
	indicate that there is validation code for that move
q6. CheckMoveIsLegal():

Task 3:
q1. GetMove

Task 5:
q1. The letter that represents the pieces colour and piece type
q2. MakeMove

Task 6:
q1. make move 

Task 7:
q1. DisplayBoard()

Task 8:
Fixed value: A variable set in code by the programmer, that is never changed or edited in the program|'
stepper: a variable that is incremented with each loop of a code|'
Most recent holder: either the latest value gain as input from the user of the variable storing the latest value created when processing|'
most wanted holder: a variable holding the variable that is most desired by the code, if searching for the highest number in a list, this would be the highest number encountered|'
gatherer: a variable that holds the total when adding a series of values|'
transformation: a variable of which its value is created from a fixed calculation of other variables|'sample game'
follower: a holder for the value stored in another variable before its updated|'
temporary: a temporary variable holding information for a short time |'temp'

Task 9:
q1. Passing by value means the variable must be passed into, and then returned from a function to be 
	edited or used by the function, if they're not returned, the changes made are not permanent. 
	Things such as number and string values must be passed around this way.
	
	Passing by reference mean the variable must be passed into the function, but any changes made
	are made across the entire program, and are permanent.
